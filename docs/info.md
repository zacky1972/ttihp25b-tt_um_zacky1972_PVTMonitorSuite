## How it works

PVTMonitorSuite integrates ring oscillators and flip-flop-based measurement circuits to quantify the timing characteristics of digital logic.

The suite supports the following measurements:

* An Inverter-based ring oscillator provides high-resolution estimates of gate propagation delay ($t_{pd}$).
* A NAND2-based ring oscillator provides high-resolution estimates of logic delay ($t_{logic}$) of NAND2.
* Standard, DICE, LEAP-DICE, and Quatro D flip-flops measure clock-to-Q and setup timing ($t_{clkq} + t_{setup}$).
* Clock skew timing ($t_{skew}$) is determined using XOR-based pulse width detection between two clock signals.

High-speed counters driven by the ring oscillators convert these delays into digital values, enabling precise evaluation of process, voltage, and temperature variations on a fully digital, open-access platform.
